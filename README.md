## Motivation for Data Engineering/Processing

1. **Data Completeness**: Handle missing or incomplete data to prevent errors in downstream processes. This includes filling in missing values or using intelligent methods to infer missing information.
2. **Data Enrichment**: Enhance the data by adding additional attributes or categories, such as industry tags or location information, using LLMs (Large Language Models) to make the data more useful for specific applications.

## Data Preprocessing - Main Steps:

## Main Functionalities of API

- User query analysis
- SQL Query generation
- Query Rechecking
- Execution of the query
- Result Formatting

All combined to form a SQL Agent

## Key Challenges 
- Data consistency issues. Like countries like usa can be united states/us also . This is solved by standardizing all the country names using the LLM in the database.
- Large Datasets querying can lead to context length exceeding. Thus i put a limit of 10 rows for now. Perhaps the separation of querying result from agentic input helps a lot.
- Correcting system prompt for the agent is an insanely frustating task. This prompt required multiple tries to make it work good using the data provided.
- streaming out response for each step of the agent seemed to be unusual at start.
- Sometimes the agent hallucinates and couldn't find the tools correctly. This is corrected by changing the system prompt a bit.
- query rechecking is more frequently done with wrong query initially. this is solved by adjusting the prompt.
- The sqlite database used is prone to memory errors. so make sure the server is not interrupted while running the query.
- The abstractness of langchain agentic classes are very convinient for more complex modifications.
- Some user queries that are not present in the database like event_industry does not contain "Oil & Gas", hence it must be searched over other columns like event_description etc.
- The conditions in the query seems to use = more than LIKE.

## Future Improvements

- Caching responses and queries can be implemented
- The system prompt can be optimized
- Better error handling can be implemented with robust API
- Question suggestions can be implemented
- Custom Data uploads/Custom knowledge base can be implemented
- Multiple conversations can be implemented
- Rate-limit and Authentication
- Feedback mechanism from the user can be implemented
